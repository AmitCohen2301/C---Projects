Information:
The project works on linux only!
This project get flags:
-l - represent the lowest number to check
-u - represent the upper number to check
-n - represent the number of primes to print
-t - represent how many threads will run

The threads move on all the numbers (each thread take the next unchecked number) and checks if 
they are primes.
At the end the main checks how many prime numbers there are in the range and print them according to 
how many we want to print.
